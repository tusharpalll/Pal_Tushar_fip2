Final Integrated Project: Couple's Resort Website
Project Description
This project is the culmination of the term, where we build upon the Couple's Resort website initially created in class. The objective was to create a fully functional website with four pages: Rooms, Spa, Sale, and Reservation.

The site includes validated HTML and a proper Document Outline for accessibility and SEO optimization.
